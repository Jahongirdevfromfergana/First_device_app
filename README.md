### Local Control

- App uses ESP Local Control(esp_local_ctrl) component in ESP-IDF and Network Service Discovery APIs to search and manage user devices on local network.
- This feature allows user to control their ESP devices over local network by communicating over Wi-Fi + HTTP.
- Local Control ensures your devices are reachable even when your internet connection is poor or there is no internet over connected Wi-Fi.

This feature can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isLocalControlSupported` field in `local.properties`.
This feature is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isLocalControlSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

### Scheduling

Schedules allow you to automate a device by setting it to trigger an action at a given time on a specified day or days of the week.
List of operations that are supported for scheduling :
 
 - Add.
 - Edit.
 - Remove.
 - Enable/disable.

Schedule can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isScheduleSupported` field in `local.properties`.
Schedule feature is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isScheduleSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

### Scene

Scene is a group of parameters with specific values, for one or more devices (optionally) spanning across multiple nodes. As an example, an "Evening" scene may turn on all the lights and set them to a warm colour. A "Night" scene may turn off all the lights, turn on a bedside lamp set to minimal brightness and turn on the fan/ac.
List of operations that are supported for scene :

- Add.

Grouping can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isNodeGroupingSupported` field in `local.properties`.
Grouping feature is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isNodeGroupingSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

### Node Sharing

Node Sharing allows a user to share nodes with other registered users and allow them to monitor and control these nodes.
List of operations that are supported in node sharing :

For primary users:
- Register requests to share nodes.
- View pending requests.
- Cancel a pending request, if required.
- Remove node sharing.

For secondary users:
- View pending requests.
- Accept/decline pending requests.

Sharing can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isNodeSharingSupported` field in `local.properties`.
Sharing feature is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isNodeSharingSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

### Device Automation

Device Automation is a set of actions that will be triggered based on the completion of certain events. For example, the user can set an event as the Temperature sensor equals 35 degrees celsius. Then based on this event user can trigger different actions like Switching on AC or Setting the AC temperature to 20 degrees celsius or a combination of both.

Users will be allowed to perform different automation operations in the app as mentioned below:

1. Adding new automation.
2. Updating existing automation.
3. Enabling/disabling automation triggers.
4. Deleting automation.
5. Receiving notifications related to triggered automation.

Device automation can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isAutomationSupported` field in `local.properties`.
Device automation is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isAutomationSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

### Time Series

- Time series allows a user to see historical values of parameters plotted as a bar or line chart.
- Users can select the different time duration to see reported parameter values like 1 day, 7 days, 4 weeks and 1 year.
- Users can see graph for raw data and can also select from different aggregate types like avg, min, max, count and latest.

Note : Time series feature requires support in firmware. It will be available only for the parameters who have "time_series" property.

### System service

System service allows a primary user of the node to perform node operations like:
- Reboot
